The .py files are mainly helper functions and other useful functions, implemented by us.

Our model is highly inspired by Keras (https://keras.io/examples/vision/deeplabv3_plus/)

The .ipynb files are where we ran our code. plot.ipynb is for plotting validation loss etc. predict is for plotting predictions. train.ipynb is for training the models.

Disclaimer: Dataset and Models are not included.

First download official FoodSeg103 dataset and then train a model.
